# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
  A function is a user-created formula that interprets and manipulates data to have a specific output. 

  Researched answer:
  A function is a procedure defined in a block of code that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function,
  you must first define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


2. What is a method?

  Your answer:
  Methods are platform/program-based tools that, like a function, perform a specific task. Unlike a function, however,
  methods come pre-installed on a program so that the user can utilize them without spending the time to write out the 
  code to perform the task.

  Researched answer:
  Methods are properties containing a function definition determining an action to be performed on objects.
  They are functions that obects are able to perform.

5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer:
  Accessor methods, I believe, are methods that extract information from existing data whereas 
  mutator methods not only access the data but manipulate it.

  Researched answer:
  Mutator methods modify the original data from arrays.Accessor methods return a new value or 
  representation


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer:
  console.log() is a call to the computer to run code - this alone may or may not have a return value
  depending on the written code. Return, however, is a call-to-action that tells the computer to return
  a response or value when prompted. 

  Researched answer:
  The return statement will stop a function when a condition is met and 'return' or call a specified value.
  Console.log is a function that prints data to the console.


7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer:
  An argument is the data that you set for a parameter in a function. Going back to functions, they operate on a
  specified data type. That data type is referred to as a parameter. The type of data for each argument is 
  often evident in the definition of a function. In the invocation of a function, the argument references a 
  specific data type which is often a variable. This variable is a defined set of data. It can be a string, 
  an array, a number, etc. The idea is that the variable holds information that a user wants to access or mutate
  to perform a specific task and get a certain response or action.

  Researched answer: 
  Arguments are object-like data that are accessible inside functions and contain values for data that is/will be
  passed into that function. They are local varialbes. Broadly speaking, variables are are containers for 
  storing data that can vary in their value. A variable becomes an arguments when/if it is passed into a function.


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer:
  Javascript is a programming language that allows users to interact with their computers and perform meaningful
  operations. It allows users to input data, extract data, and 

  Researched answer:
  Javascript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex concepts on web pages. Beyond simply
  viewing a webpage as a page with text, Javascript allows for dynamic content, multimedia control, animation, and
  lots of other amazing features. Javascript can update and change HTML and CSS and calculates, manipulates, and 
  validates data.


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer:
  Proper pair progrmming techniques include the division of work into roles. One person operates as what
  is referred to as a 'navigator' while the other works as a 'driver.' The navigator guides the driver through
  the process of writing the code. He/She uses his/her voice to explain the process of a task from start to finish
  to help the driver produce efficient, effective, and, most importantly, readable code. The idea of pair programming
  is that two minds are greater than one, and, while one person coding alone might waste a lot of time working
  on a task, a second person who knows a shortcut or can identify errors in what a driver writes will ultimately 
  save time and headaches in the coding process. Hopefully, the output is also much cleaner and more readable 
  code. It is a navigator's responsibility to respect a driver's process and to not take control of the commands.
  For a specified amount of time, their duty is to simply advise the driver using their voice. After the time is up,
  the navigator and driver switch roles.
